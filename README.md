# CodingQuestions


This repository is created to answer a set of programming exercises, and its structure is such that for the first question (Predictive analysis), each part has its own separate folder, and for the second question, only one folder has been created collectively.
The folder guide is as follows:

Predictive Analysis A: `.\Predictive Analysis\Text Classification`

Predictive Analysis B: `.\Predictive Analysis\OCR`

Predictive Analysis C: `.\Predictive Analysis\Features Combination`

Predictive Analysis D:`.\Predictive Analysis\Classic Classifiers`

Descriptive Analysis: `.\Descriptive Analysis`

At the time of implementation, it has been tried to use as many different approaches as possible to show the familiarity of the coder with different paradigms. It should be noted that due to the restrictions on Iranian programmers, the possibility of using **Kaggle** was not available to me, and to use **Google Colab**, I only had to use the free mode because it was not possible to pay.

Some of the code snippets in this implementation have been copied from existing implementations without any modification, which I know is my duty to thank them. Big thanks to [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/squaredr/memotion-analysis-on-image "this notebook") and [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mozattt/fake-news-eda-and-model-baseline "this notebook") for their great contributions and to many others for their inspiring ideas.
